# Excel VBA Automation: Placement & Creative QA Toolkit
Refreshing my 2021 VBA macro that I built pre-GPT that benefitted greatly from an AI refresh. Always looking to improve legacy processes üëç

## Overview  
This toolkit is a compilation of simple tools (at least the macros without sensitive details specialized for clients) for many QA and reporting tasks across media operations.

This sheet builds on VBA I originally learned through StackOverflow, MrExcel, and VBAExpress. With that foundation and GenAI, I rebuilt a cleaner, more dynamic version in under an hour - something that would‚Äôve taken weeks manually.

This is one of my favorite examples of AI-assisted coding: a simple VBA tool that saves teams hours on repetitive, tedious tasks while improving standardization across files, QA, and naming. It's a toolkit thats not about replacing people - it‚Äôs about delegating the annoying parts to the robots so humans can focus on strategy and insights.

## Tech Used  
- Excel VBA (self‚Äëtaught pre‚ÄëLLM, later AI‚Äëtuned)  
- FileDialog integration  
- Dynamic header detection  
- Conditional formatting  
- Data validation  

## How It Works  
Each macro batch runs via the VBA editor or toolbar buttons to:  
- Reset Excel defaults after errors  
- Parse taxonomy strings into structured columns  
- Merge selected workbooks into a master sheet  
- Format CSV or SQL exports with styles and freeze pane  
- Save workbooks to Downloads with timestamped names  
- Unlock Protected View files for other macros  
- Remove placeholder tildes in data ranges  

## Highlighted Functions  

### 1. ResetSettings  
Restores alerts, screen updating, calculation mode, and scrollbars to troubleshoot display or behavior issues.

### 2. TaxonomyKeyParse  
Parses client taxonomy keys (KEY~Value_) into separate columns for each key.

### 3. MergeExcelSheets  
Prompts file selection and consolidates data from multiple workbooks into one sheet without duplicate headers.

### 4. FormatCSV  
Styles header row with bold fill and center alignment, auto‚Äëfits columns, and freezes the top pane.

### 5. QuickSave  
Saves the active workbook as XLSX in the Downloads folder with a timestamped name or prompts manual save on error.

### 6. UnprotectSheets  
Opens Protected View workbooks in edit mode so automated routines can run without interruption.

### 7. ReplaceTildes  
Replaces ‚Äú~~‚Äù in selected ranges to simplify super-common lookup placeholders, ctrl-f, filter searches, and clean up data.

## Business Value & Use Cases  
- **Time savings**: weeks of manual coding into hours with AI assistance  
- **Error reduction**: prevents silent failures and enforces standards  
- **Team efficiency**: non‚Äëtechnical users run macros via buttons  
- **Scalability**: handles varying data sizes with no hardcoded ranges  
- **Human augmentation**: frees employees to focus on strategic work and innovation  

## Notes  
- Built manually before LLMs and later refined with AI assistants  
- Saves the team many hours of tedious work each month  
- Demonstrates AI as an assistant to augment human capabilities, not replace jobs
