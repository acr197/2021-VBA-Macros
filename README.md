# Excel VBA Automation: Pre-Trafficking Validator

## Overview  
This VBA script streamlines campaign trafficking setup by automatically checking for common data issues and applying consistent formatting. Built to prevent errors *before* trafficking begins, it reduces rework and accelerates launch readiness.

## Tech Used  
- Excel VBA (self-taught, pre-AI codebase)  
- Conditional formatting  
- Data validation  
- Logic-based formatting rules  
- Auto-format and cleanup routines  

## How It Works  
Each run of the macro performs end-to-end prep on a trafficking sheet:  
- Verifies column headers to catch changes or drift  
- Clears old formats and resets validation across the grid  
- Applies conditional formatting to flag:  
  - Missing or invalid status values  
  - URLs with spaces or missing protocols  
  - Expiring placement or asset dates  
  - Mismatched creative dimensions  
- Enforces dropdown validation for key fields (Status, Verification, Survey, etc.)  
- Auto-adjusts column widths and date formats for consistency  
- Dynamically scales to the size of your data—no hardcoded limits  

## Highlighted Functions  

### 1. Pre-Trafficking QA Logic  
Flags bad URLs, status mismatches, or missing dependencies in key cells before downstream systems touch them.

### 2. Conditional Highlighting for Human Review  
Colors rows red or orange if logic or data rules are violated (e.g. 1x1 creatives with blocking tags).

### 3. Self-Healing Formatting  
Wipes old styles and reapplies structure based on current headers and data range, so the sheet stays clean over time.

### 4. Input Validation  
Dropdown lists enforce standard values in cells prone to inconsistency or typos, reducing errors in ad operations.

### 5. Scalable & Dynamic  
Works across thousands of rows and any number of URL or dimension columns without manual range updates.

## Business Value & Use Cases  
- **Media operations**: speeds up trafficking handoff, improves QA  
- **Campaign delivery**: reduces human error and launch delays  
- **Template enforcement**: keeps sheets clean regardless of who last edited  
- **Data-driven logic**: foundational for downstream automation and system ingestion  
- **Impact**: helped reduce trafficking errors by nearly 50% and became a standard, positively-reviewed part of every client’s setup process

## Notes  
- Built independently while learning VBA—no LLMs used during development  
- Post-build, I've since applied AI (ChatGPT, OpenAI) to accelerate and refine newer scripts  
- This version remains valuable as proof of process thinking, logic design, and automation enablement
